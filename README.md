# [Multi Tab Rows](https://github.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/blob/main/MultiTabRows%40Merci.chao.uc.js)
Make Firefox support multiple rows of tabs.

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/refs/heads/main/screenshots/scrolling.png)
## Highlights
- **üóÇÔ∏è Tab Groups Support:** Fully supports mouse operations for tab groups ‚Äî even in multi-row mode ‚Äî delivering a smoother, more graceful experience.
- **üéûÔ∏è Enhanced Tab Animations:** Adds fluid transitions for various tab-related actions.
- **üìê Optimized Space Usage:** Makes full use of available UI space, including the area beneath window control buttons. (requires manual enabling)
- **üñ±Ô∏è Smooth Tab-Dragging Animation:** Supports animated tab dragging even in multi-row mode.
- **üìå Pinned Tabs Grid Layout:** Pinned tabs are fixed in a compact grid when Tabs Bar is scrollable ‚Äî ideal for managing large numbers of pinned tabs.
- **ü¶ä Native-Like Firefox Integration:** Seamlessly aligns with Firefox‚Äôs behavior to support multi-row tabs as if natively built-in.
- **üé® Theme Compatibility:** Fully compatible with themes, regardless of how many tab rows are present.

## Compatibility
- Firefox 115, 142 to 144 (excluding 128), for Windows 7 to 11.
- Supports general script loaders, like xiaoxiaoflood's userChromeJS (Firefox Scripts).

## Cautions
**üö® Please read the following notes carefully before using this script:**
- ‚ùó **Since this script contains many sensitive layout calculations designed for native Firefox, any tab or Tabs Bar-related legacy extensions (e.g. [Tab Mix Plus](https://onemen.github.io/tabmixplus-docs)), user scripts or CSS styles can cause weird glitches and bugs. Please check your legacy extensions, scripts and styles (if any) before and after applying this script, or disable the [`tabsUnderControlButtons`](#tabsUnderControlButtons) feature provided by this script.**
- This is an unofficial (and complicated) script maintained solely by me. This script may contain unforeseen bugs and is not guaranteed to be compatible with the latest versions of Firefox. If an unexpected issue occurs, restarting Firefox may be necessary. In extreme cases ‚Äî especially when using an outdated version of the script with a newly updated Firefox ‚Äî the browser may become unusable, potentially resulting in the permanent loss of your previous browsing session. You may need to disable the script in such situations. Please use this script only if you are capable of and prepared to handle these risks.
- This script is developed for Windows and probably does not work on Ubuntu (Linux) and macOS.
- This script needs to override some functions of Firefox and requires [`security.allow_unsafe_dangerous_privileged_evil_eval`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1958232) to be enabled on Firefox 139+ for this purpose. The said setting is enabled automatically once you are applying this script, and it requires a manual disabling through `about:config` after disabling or removing the script. Please note that and use this script with understanding.

## Installation
1. If you are not using any scripts, follow the instructions in the üìò [Tab Mix Plus - Docs](https://onemen.github.io/tabmixplus-docs/other/installation/#install-firefox-scripts) to install the script loader (Firefox Scripts). You can skip this step if you have already installed some scripts.<br>
<br>![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/refs/heads/main/screenshots/installscriptloader.png)
2. Download the üì• [script file](https://github.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/raw/refs/heads/main/MultiTabRows@Merci.chao.uc.js) and place it into the `chrome` folder.
3. Restart Firefox to apply.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Please make sure that no other Tabs Bar-related scripts and CSS styles are currently activated. Just in case, temporarily move all other `.js` and `.css` files out of the `chrome` folder. Restart Firefox and confirm that the script works as expected. Once verified, you can move the files back into the folder, and modify the scripts and style rules which cause conflict.
> - If the script loader stops working after updating Firefox, please visit the page above and reinstall the latest version of the script loader.

## Settings
Open [`about:config`](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/about-config-editor-firefox) and search for the prefix `userChromeJS.multiTabRows@Merci.chao.`. Settings shown in gray are disabled due to other preferences.

If configuring via `user.js` (not recommended), be sure to include the prefix `userChromeJS.multiTabRows@Merci.chao.`.<br>Example: `user_pref("userChromeJS.multiTabRows@Merci.chao.maxTabRows", 5);`.

> [!NOTE]
> Many of these settings may not take effect due to dependencies with other preferences. It is strongly recommended to configure them via `about:config` rather than using `user.js`.

| Name (w/ prefix) | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `animateTabMoveMaxCount` | When the number of dragged tabs exceeds this value, drag animations are disabled and a drop indicator is shown instead. The minimum value is `0`. If dragging too many tabs causes lag, consider lowering this value.<br>üìù Note: Some tab grouping operations may be unavailable, and the final drop position is determined by Firefox's native behavior, which may not behave as expected in certain scenarios. |
| `animationDuration` | Duration of animations in milliseconds (valid range: `0` - `1000`). Note: Lengthy animations could strain system performance. |
| `autoCollapse` | **üö® EXPERIMENTAL üß™**<br>Tabs will collapse to a single row when the cursor is not hovering. Enabling this feature will forcibly disable `tabsUnderControlButtons`, and pinned tabs are no longer fixed in position. On Firefox 115, setting `layout.css.has-selector.enabled` as `true` is required.
| `autoCollapseDelayCollapsing` | Delay before collapsing the tabs when the cursor moves away (in milliseconds). |
| `autoCollapseDelayExpanding` | Delay before expanding the tabs when the cursor hovers over them (in milliseconds). |
| `checkUpdate` | Check for a new version of this script when Firefox starts up or opens new windows. Set it to `2` or larger to enable or `0` to disable. The value will be updated with the last checking time. Please do not set it to `1` as it will be treated as first installed.<br><b>üí° Enabling it is strongly recommended, as outdated scripts are unlikely to function properly on newer versions of Firefox.</b> |
| `checkUpdateAutoApply` | Update the script file automatically when there is a new version:<ul><li>`0` - never</li><li>`1` - ask</li><li>`2` - always</li><li>`3` - always and slient</li></ul> |
| `checkUpdateFrequency` | How often to check for new versions (days). The minimum value is `1`. |
| `compactControlButtons` | Display the window control buttons to a compact size, only available on Windows 10 and 11. |
| `debugMode` | ‚õî Mode for debugging, not for general use. |
| `dragToGroupTabs` | Enable tab grouping when dragging tabs over another. Disabling this setting results in behavior that differs from when `browser.tabs.dragDrop.moveOverThresholdPercent` is set to `50` or below: the disabled state allows tabs to be added to or removed from a group without altering their order. Not available on Firefox 115 or `browser.tabs.groups.enabled` is `false`. |
| `dynamicMoveOverThreshold` | Make tab-dragging movement smoother in certain scenarios, e.g. dragging pinned or grouped tabs. Not available on Firefox 115, or either `dragToGroupTabs` or `browser.tabs.groups.enabled` is `false`. |
| `dynamicThemeImageSize` | When using themes, the size of the background image changes with the current number of rows. |
| `floatingBackdropBlurriness` | How blurry the background of items covering the tabs is when Tabs Bar is scrollable, available when `tabsUnderControlButtons` is `2` and both `floatingBackdropClip` & `nativeWindowStyle` are `false`. The minimum value is `0`. Not available on Firefox 115. |
| `floatingBackdropClip` | Clip the area covered by items on the Tabs Bar when it is scrollable, available when `tabsUnderControlButtons` is `2`. |
| `floatingBackdropOpacity` | How opaque the background of items covering the tab is when Tabs Bar is scrollable, available when `tabsUnderControlButtons` is `2` and `floatingBackdropClip` is `false`. The value should be from `0` to `100`. |

| `hideDragPreview` | Hide the drag preview during a drag interaction:<ul><li>`0` - never</li><li>`1` - tab groups only</li><li>`2` - tabs only</li><li>`3` - both</li></ul> |
| `hideEmptyPlaceholderWhenScrolling` | If there is no item in the upper left corner, hide the empty space in that corner when Tabs Bar is scrollable, available when `tabsUnderControlButtons` is `2`. |
| `hidePinnedDropIndicator` | Hide the indicator that appears when dragging a tab to pin it, if there are no existing pinned tabs (Firefox 143 and beyond). |
| `hideScrollButtonsWhenDragging` | Hide the up/down scroll buttons when dragging. |
| `justifyCenter` | Justify tabs to the center horizontally:<ul><li>`0` - never</li><li>`1` - when there is only one row</li><li>`2` - always</li></ul>Behaviors such as closing tabs and collapsing tab groups may differ slightly when tabs are centered. |
| `linesToDragScroll` | How many rows to scroll when dragging tabs to top/bottom edge. The minimum value is `1`. |
| `linesToScroll` | How many rows to scroll when using the mouse wheel. The minimum value is `1`. |

| `nativeWindowStyle` | Display the system-native theme style (e.g. effects from tools like [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass)) on Tabs Bar. To achieve the full visual effect on Windows 11, you may also need to enable `widget.windows.mica`. This behaves similarly to `browser.theme.windows.accent-color-in-tabs.enabled` when DWM tools are not used on Windows 10. Not available on Firefox 115, or using any Firefox theme. |
| `pinnedTabsFlexWidth` | **üö® EXPERIMENTAL üß™**<br>Make pinned tab sizing behave like normal tabs. Pinned tabs will no longer be fixed in position when Tabs Bar is scrollable. |
| `rowIncreaseEvery` | Each time the window width is increased by this amount, one more row is allowed. When set to the minimum value `0`, the maximum number of rows is directly allowed to be displayed. |
| `rowStartIncreaseFrom` | When the window width is larger than this number plus `rowIncreaseEvery`, multi-row display is allowed. |
| `scrollbarThumbColor` | Color of the scrollbar thumb, must be a valid CSS color, variable, or the keyword `auto`. |
| `scrollbarTrackColor` | Color of the scrollbar track, must be a valid CSS color, variable, or the keyword `auto`. |

| `tabsbarItemsAlign` | Alignment of the items in Tabs Bar:<ul><li>`start` - top</li><li>`center` - middle</li><li>`end` - bottom</li></ul>This setting is only valid when `tabsUnderControlButtons` is `0`, or `1` with Tabs Bar is scrollable. |
| `tabsUnderControlButtons` | <a name="tabsUnderControlButtons"></a>**üö® EXPERIMENTAL üß™**<br>Show tabs beneath window control buttons when there are multiple rows:<ul><li>`0` - never</li><li>`1` - when Tabs Bar is not scrollable</li><li>`2` - always</li></ul>If any issues occur, set the value to `0` or `1` to disable or partially disable this feature. |
| `thinScrollbar` | Use a thin scrollbar without up and down buttons. |

## Advanced Tweaks
You can use [`userChrome.css`](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/contributors-guide-firefox-advanced-customization) to tweak the following parameters to control tab size and spacing. The values shown below are default settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using decimal values or units other than pixels (`px`). 

``` css
:root {
  /* Horizontal space between tabs */
  --tab-overflow-clip-margin: 2px !important;

  /* Horizontal padding of tabs */
  --tab-inline-padding: 8px !important;

  /* Height of tab content: compact - 29px, normal - 36px, touch - 41px, should not small than 24px */
  --tab-min-height: 36px !important;
	
  /* Vertical space between tabs */
  --tab-block-margin: 4px !important;
}

/*
  This rule is necessary when: var(--tab-min-height) + var(--tab-block-margin) * 2 < 33px
  Why 33px? The default height of .tab-label-container is 2.7em,
  which is 32.4px when the font size is 12px,
  and the tab should be taller than the .tab-label-container inside.
  Otherwise the tab height will contain decimal and cause issues.
  Example:
  - --tab-min-height = 29px
  - --tab-block-margin = 1px
  ‚Üí Total: 29 + 1√ó2 = 31px
  Since 31px < 33px, then this rule needs to apply to prevent layout issues.
*/
.tab-label-container {
  height: auto !important;
}

.tab-content[pinned] {
  /* Horizontal padding of pinned tabs */
  padding-inline: 10px !important;
}

tab-group {
  /* Horizontal padding in tab groups */
  --group-line-padding: 3px !important;
}

.tab-group-label {
  /* Max width of the labels of tab groups. It's OK to use other units */
  max-width: 10em;
}
```

There also few settings in `about:config` for the layout of tabs:

| Name (w/o prefix) | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `browser.tabs.tabClipWidth` | Close button will show on the tabs that are wider than this size. |
| `browser.tabs.tabMinWidth` | Minimum width of normal tabs, including the white space around. |
| `widget.windows.mica` | Apply the native system style on Tabs Bar (Windows 11). |
| `widget.windows.mica.toplevel-backdrop` | Choose the effect of backdrop (Windows 11).<ul><li>`0` - Auto</li><li>`1` - Mica</li><li>`2` - Acrylic</li><li>`3` - Mica Alt</li></ul> |
| `browser.theme.windows.accent-color-in-tabs.enabled` | Apply the system accent color on Tabs Bar (Windows 10). |
