## Compatibility
- Firefox 115, 143 to 145 (excluding ESR versions), for Windows 7 to 11.
- Supports general script loaders, like xiaoxiaoflood's userChromeJS (Firefox Scripts).

## Cautions
**üö® Please read the following notes carefully before using this script:**
- ‚ùó **Since this script contains many sensitive layout calculations designed for native Firefox, any tab-related legacy extensions (e.g. [Tab Mix Plus](https://onemen.github.io/tabmixplus-docs)), user scripts (`userChrome.js`) or CSS styles (`userChrome.css`) can cause weird glitches and bugs. **Please follow the installation steps below carefully.**
- This is an unofficial (and complicated) script maintained solely by me. This script may contain unforeseen bugs and is not guaranteed to keep compatible with the latest versions of Firefox. If an unexpected issue occurs, restarting Firefox may be necessary. In extreme cases ‚Äî especially when using an outdated version of the script with a newly updated Firefox ‚Äî the browser may become unusable, potentially resulting in the permanent loss of your previous browsing session. You may need to disable the script in such situations. Please use this script only if you are capable of and prepared to handle these risks.
- This script is developed for Windows and probably does not work on Ubuntu (Linux) and macOS.
- This script needs to override some functions of Firefox and requires [`security.allow_unsafe_dangerous_privileged_evil_eval`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1958232) to be enabled on Firefox 139+ for this purpose. The said setting is enabled automatically once you are applying this script, and it requires a manual disabling through `about:config` after disabling or removing the script. Please note that and use this script with understanding.

## Installation
1. Follow the instructions in the üìò[Tab Mix Plus - Docs](https://onemen.github.io/tabmixplus-docs/other/installation/#install-firefox-scripts) to install the script loader (Firefox Scripts) if you are not using any scripts. Skip this step if some scripts are already in use.
<br>![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/refs/heads/main/screenshots/installscriptloader.png)
2. Make sure that no other tab-related scripts and CSS styles are currently in use. Just in case, temporarily move all other `.js` (excluding `userChrome.js`, if any) and `.css` files out of `chrome`. **There are many reports of issues caused by conflicts with customized styles.**
3. Download the üì•[script file](https://github.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/raw/refs/heads/main/MultiTabRows@Merci.chao.uc.js) and place it into `chrome`.
4. Restart Firefox to apply.
5. If you moved some files out of `chrome` in step 2, please confirm that this script works as expected. Once verified, you can move the files back. If any conflicts arise, modify the scripts and style rules accordingly. If you need help, please provide the information üõü[here](https://github.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/issues/new).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the script loader stops working after updating Firefox, please visit the page above and reinstall the latest version of the script loader.

## Settings
Open [`about:config`](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/about-config-editor-firefox) and search for the prefix `userChromeJS.multiTabRows@Merci.chao.`. Settings shown in gray are disabled due to other preferences.

If configuring via `user.js` (not recommended), be sure to include the prefix `userChromeJS.multiTabRows@Merci.chao.`. Example:
```js
user_pref("userChromeJS.multiTabRows@Merci.chao.maxTabRows", 5);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Many of these settings may not take effect due to dependencies with other preferences. It is strongly recommended to configure them via `about:config` rather than using `user.js`.

### Operations

| Name (w/ prefix) | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `animateTabMoveMaxCount` | When the number of dragged tabs exceeds this value, drag animations are disabled and a drop indicator is shown instead. The minimum value is `0`. If dragging too many tabs causes lag, consider lowering this value.<br>üìù Note: Some tab grouping operations may be unavailable, and the final drop position is determined by Firefox's native behavior, which may not behave as expected in certain scenarios (Firefox bug [#1985434](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1985434), [#1988159](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1988159), [#1988162](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1988162), [#1988194](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1988194)). |

Not available on Firefox 115 or `browser.tabs.groups.enabled` is `false`. |
| `dynamicMoveOverThreshold` | Make tab-dragging movement smoother in certain scenarios, e.g. dragging pinned or grouped tabs. Not available on Firefox 115, or either `dragToGroupTabs` or `browser.tabs.groups.enabled` is `false`. |

### Layout

| Name (w/ prefix) | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `autoCollapse` | **üö® EXPERIMENTAL üß™**<br>Tabs will collapse to a single row when the cursor is not hovering. Enabling this feature will forcibly disable `tabsUnderControlButtons`, and pinned tabs are no longer fixed in position.

| `pinnedTabsFlexWidthIndicator` | Display an icon on pinned tabs. |
| `rowIncreaseEvery` | Each time the window width is increased by this amount, one more row is allowed. When set to the minimum value `0`, the maximum number of rows is directly allowed to be displayed. |
| `rowStartIncreaseFrom` | When the window width is larger than this number plus `rowIncreaseEvery`, multi-row display is allowed. |
| `spaceAfterTabs` | Empty space before the window control buttons. The minimum value is `0`. |
| `spaceAfterTabsOnMaximizedWindow` | Empty space before the window control buttons, when maximumized. The minimum value is `0`. |

| `tabsUnderControlButtons` | <a name="tabsUnderControlButtons"></a>**üö® EXPERIMENTAL üß™**<br>Show tabs beneath window control buttons when there are multiple rows:<ul><li>`0` - never</li><li>`1` - when Tabs Bar is not scrollable (legacy option, not recommended)</li><li>`2` - always</li></ul>If any issues occur, set the value to `0` to disable this feature. |
| `thinScrollbar` | Use a thin scrollbar without up and down buttons. |

| `nativeWindowStyle` | Display the system-native theme style (e.g. effects from tools like [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass)) on Tabs Bar. To achieve the full visual effect on Windows 11, you may also need to enable `widget.windows.mica`. This behaves similarly to `browser.theme.windows.accent-color-in-tabs.enabled` when DWM tools are not used on Windows 10. Not available on Firefox 115, or using any Firefox theme with background image. |
| `scrollbarThumbColor` | Color of the scrollbar thumb, must be a valid CSS color, variable, or the keyword `auto`. |

The value will be updated with the last checking time (e.g. `1759911972`).<br><b>üí° Enabling it is strongly recommended, as outdated scripts are unlikely to function properly on newer versions of Firefox.</b><br>üìù Note: Updates for this script will not be notified when using older versions of Firefox (except 115). |
| `checkUpdateAutoApply` | Update the script file automatically when there is a new version:<ul><li>`0` - never</li><li>`1` - ask</li><li>`2` - always</li><li>`3` - always and sliently, also receive updates for minor changes and fixes that do not trigger notifications</li></ul> |
| `checkUpdateFrequency` | How often to check for new versions (days). The minimum value is `1`. |
| `debugMode` | ‚õî Mode for debugging, not for general use. |

## Advanced Tweaks
You can use [`userChrome.css`](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/contributors-guide-firefox-advanced-customization) to tweak the following parameters to control tab size and spacing. The values shown below are default settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid using decimal values or units other than pixels (`px`). 

```css
:root {
  /* Horizontal space between tabs */
  --tab-overflow-clip-margin: 2px !important;

  /* Horizontal padding of tabs */
  --tab-inline-padding: 8px !important;

  /* Height of tab content: compact - 29px, normal - 36px, touch - 41px, should not small than 24px */
  --tab-min-height: 36px !important;
	
  /* Vertical space between tabs */
  --tab-block-margin: 4px !important;
}

/*
  This rule is necessary when: var(--tab-min-height) + var(--tab-block-margin) * 2 < 33px
  Why 33px? The default height of .tab-label-container is 2.7em,
  which is 32.4px when the font size is 12px,
  and the tab should be taller than the .tab-label-container inside.
  Otherwise the tab height will contain decimal and cause issues.
  Example:
  - --tab-min-height = 29px
  - --tab-block-margin = 1px
  ‚Üí Total: 29 + 1√ó2 = 31px
  Since 31px < 33px, then this rule needs to apply to prevent layout issues.
*/
.tab-label-container {
  height: auto !important;
}

.tab-content[pinned] {
  /* Horizontal padding of pinned tabs */
  padding-inline: 10px !important;
}

#tabbrowser-tabs {
  /* Horizontal padding in tab groups */
  --group-line-padding: 3px !important;

  /* Max width of the labels of tab groups. It's OK to use other units */
  --group-label-max-width: 10em !important;
}
```

There also few settings in `about:config` for the layout of tabs:

| Name (w/o prefix) | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `browser.tabs.tabClipWidth` | Close button will show on the tabs that are wider than this size. |
| `browser.tabs.tabMinWidth` | Minimum width of normal tabs, including the white space around. |
| `widget.windows.mica` | Apply the native system style on Tabs Bar (Windows 11). |
| `widget.windows.mica.toplevel-backdrop` | Choose the effect of backdrop (Windows 11).<ul><li>`0` - Auto</li><li>`1` - Mica</li><li>`2` - Acrylic</li><li>`3` - Mica Alt</li></ul> |
| `browser.theme.windows.accent-color-in-tabs.enabled` | Apply the system accent color on Tabs Bar (Windows 10). |
