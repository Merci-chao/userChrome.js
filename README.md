# [Multi Tab Rows](https://github.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/blob/main/MultiTabRows%40Merci.chao.uc.js)
Make Firefox support multiple rows of tabs.

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/refs/heads/main/screenshots/scrolling.png)
## Highlights
- **üóÇÔ∏è Tab Groups Support:** Fully supports tab groups and fine-tunes tab operation for a smoother experience.
- **üéûÔ∏è Enhanced Tab Animations:** Adds fluid transitions for various tab-related actions.
- **üìê Optimized Space Usage:** Makes full use of available UI space, including the area beneath window control buttons.
- **üñ±Ô∏è Smooth Tab-Dragging Animation:** Supports animated tab dragging even in multi-row mode.
- **üìå Pinned Tabs Grid Layout:** Pinned tabs are fixed in a compact grid when the Tabs Bar scrolls ‚Äî ideal for managing large numbers of pinned tabs.
- **ü¶ä Native-Like Firefox Integration:** Seamlessly aligns with Firefox‚Äôs behavior to support multi-row tabs as if natively built-in.
- **üé® Theme Compatibility:** Fully compatible with themes, regardless of how many tab rows are present.

## Compatibility
- Firefox 115, 140, 141, for Windows 7 to 11.
- Supports general script loaders, like xiaoxiaoflood's userChromeJS.

## Cautions
**‚ö†Ô∏è Please read the following notes carefully before using this script:**
- This is an unofficial (and complicated) script maintained solely by me. It may contain unforeseen bugs and does not guarantee compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox. In extreme cases, particularly when using an outdated version of this script with a newly updated Firefox, it could render the browser unusable and potentially result in the permanent loss of your previous browsing session. Please use this script only if you are prepared to handle such situations.
- This script needs to override some functions of Firefox and requires [`security.allow_unsafe_dangerous_privileged_evil_eval`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1958232) to be enabled on Firefox 139+ for this purpose, which may weaken the security of your browser in some special cases. The said setting is enabled automatically once you are applying this script, and it requires a manual disabling through `about:config` after disabling or removing the script. Please note that and use this script with understanding.
- Since this script contains many sensitive layout calculations designed for native Firefox, any tab or Tabs Bar-related legacy extensions (e.g. [Tab Mix Plus](https://github.com/onemen/TabMixPlus)), user scripts or styles can cause weird glitches and bugs. Please check your legacy extensions, scripts and styles (if any) before and after applying this script.
- This script is developed for Windows and probably does not work on Linux and macOS.

## Installation
1. Follow the instructions in the [Tab Mix Plus - Docs](https://onemen.github.io/tabmixplus-docs/other/installation/#install-firefox-scripts) to install the Firefox Scripts, including `configuration files` and `utils`.
2. Download the [script file](https://github.com/Merci-chao/userChrome.js/raw/refs/heads/main/MultiTabRows@Merci.chao.uc.js) and place it in your `chrome` folder.
3. Restart Firefox to apply.

ü™ß Note: If the script loader stops working after updating Firefox, please visit the page above and reinstall the latest version of the script loader.

## Settings
Open [`about:config`](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/about-config-editor-firefox) and search for the prefix `userChromeJS.multiTabRows@Merci.chao`. Settings shown in gray are disabled due to other configurations.

| Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `checkUpdate` | Check for a new version of this script when Firefox starts up or opens new windows. Set it to `1` to enable or `0` to disable. The value will be updated with the last checking time. <br><b>üí° Enabling it is strongly recommended, as outdated scripts are unlikely to function properly on newer versions of Firefox.</b> |
| `checkUpdateFrequency` | How often to check for new versions (days). The minimum value is `1`. |
| `compactControlButtons` | Display the window control buttons to a compact size, only available on Windows 10 and 11, unavailable when Mica is activated and [Accent Color on Title Bars](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/3290d30f-d064-5cfe-6470-2fe9c6533e37) is inactivated. |
| `debugMode` | ‚õî Mode for debugging, not for general use. |
| `dragToGroupTabs` | Enable tab grouping when dragging tabs over another. Disabling this setting results in behavior that differs from when `browser.tabs.dragDrop.moveOverThresholdPercent` is set to `50` or below: the disabled state allows tabs to be added to or removed from a group without altering their order. Not available on Firefox 115 or `browser.tabs.groups.enabled` is `false`. |

| `dynamicThemeImageSize` | When using themes, the size of the background image changes with the current number of rows. |
| `floatingBackdropBlurriness` | How blurry the background of items covering the tabs is when scrolling, available when `tabsUnderControlButtons` is `2` and both `floatingBackdropClip` & `nativeWindowStyle` are `false`. The minimum value is `0`. Not available on Firefox 115. |

| `gapAfterPinned` | Empty space between the pinned tabs and normal tabs. The minimum value is `0`. |
| `hideAllTabs` | Hide the "List all tabs" button. Only available on Firefox 115. On newer versions of Firefox, you may remove it by right-clicking on it and choosing "Remove from Toolbar". |
| `hideEmptyPlaceholderWhenScrolling` | If there is no item in the upper left corner, hide the empty space in that corner when scrolling, available when `tabsUnderControlButtons` is `2`. |
| `linesToDragScroll` | How many rows to scroll when dragging tabs to top/bottom edge. The minimum value is `1`. |
| `linesToScroll` | How many rows to scroll when using the mouse wheel. The minimum value is `1`. |
| `maxTabRows` | Maximum number of rows to display at once. The minimum value is `1`. |
| `nativeWindowStyle` | Display the system-native theme style on Tabs Bar (e.g. effects from DWM tools). Not available on Firefox 115, or using any Firefox theme. |
| `rowIncreaseEvery` | Each time the window width is increased by this amount, one more row is allowed. When set to the minimum value `0`, the maximum number of rows is directly allowed to be displayed. |

| `spaceAfterTabsOnMaximizedWindow` | Empty space before the window control buttons, when maximumized. The minimum value is `0`. |
| `spaceBeforeTabs` | Empty space on the left side of the window. The minimum value is `0`. |
| `spaceBeforeTabsOnMaximizedWindow` | Empty space on the left side of the window, when maximumized. The minimum value is `0`. |
| `tabsbarItemsAlign` | Alignment of the Tabs Bar, allowed values are: `start` (top), `center` and `end` (bottom). This setting is only valid when `tabsUnderControlButtons` is `0`, or `1` with rows scrolling. |
| `tabsUnderControlButtons` | Show tabs beneath window control buttons when there are multiple rows: `0` (never), `1` (when rows are not scrolling), `2` (always).<br>**ü™ß Note:** This feature is experimental and may contain bugs or glitches. If any issues occur, set the value to `0` or `1` to disable or partially disable this feature. |
| `thinScrollbar` | Use a thin scrollbar without up and down buttons. |
